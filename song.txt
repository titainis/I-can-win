Don't you notice how
I get quiet when there's no one else around?
Me and you and awkward silence
Don't you dare look at me that way
I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same
----------------------------
Oh, the burning pain
Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate
"She's so perfect, " blah, blah, blah
Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day
Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say
-----------------------------
That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?
Confess I loved you from the start
