What's a girl to do?
Lying on my bed, staring into the blue
Unrequited, terrifying
Love is driving me a bit insane
Have to get this off my chest
I'm telling you today
-------------------------------
That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?
Confess I loved you from the start
-------------------------------
Confess I loved you
Just thinking of you
I know I've loved you from the start
